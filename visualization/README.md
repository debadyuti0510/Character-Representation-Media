## Back-end 
This is a Python flask app.

To start this follow the steps:

1. Open an anaconda prompt, create an environment with python, and install some required packages. Run the commands below to do all these: 

- conda create -n flask_env python Flask flask-cors bokeh

- conda activate flask_env 

2. Now you can start the flask server. Run the following commands: 

- cd visualization/backend (Run cd into the directory of the code:) 

- set FLASK_ENV=App (for Windows) or export FLASK_APP=App (for Ubuntu)

- flask run 

## Front-end
This is a React app.

To start this follow the steps:

You need now to run the front-end. This is in the directory “visualization/frontend”. 
I use npm for building and running this. You can use npm if you prefer that:

1. Install nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

2. Install npm

3. Open a cmd console and run 

- npm add @craco/craco

4. Now you can start the React application. Run the following commands in a cmd console:

- cd visualization/frontend 

- npm run build (only first time)

- npm start
