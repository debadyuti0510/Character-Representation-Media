# ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM USER STUDY ON VISUALIZING THE CHARACTER REPRESENTATION ANALYTICS FROM OUR CLIP PIPELINE

This repository contains the code for the analysis of data from the user study we conducted.

We collected data from 30 participants to evalutate the understandability of the presented information, the trust of participants in our models for the predictions of gender and age, the usefulness of our tool, and the user experience. 

- analysis_open_ended: analysis of the two open-ended questions in the user study
- data: the data we collected from the study
- prequestionnaire.ipynb: demographic analytics of our participants
- analysis.ipynb: Bayesian inference of the closed-loop questions according to Taka et al.
